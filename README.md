# Decentralized-Voting-System

## ðŸ“– Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant blockchain-based solution that enables anyone to conduct fair elections or polls without a central authority.

- **Real-Time Results**: Anyone can fetch current vote tallies and see the winner after voting ends.
- **Multiple Candidates**: Supports any number of candidates initialized during deployment.

## ðŸ”­ Future Scope
- Integration with Chainlink VRF for randomized tie-breakers.
- Off-chain voter registration using zero-knowledge proofs.
- Front-end UI using React and Ethers.js for user-friendly interaction.
